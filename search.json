This will copy all the branches mentioned before. Then provide a name and description of your repository, and choose if the repository has to be Public or Private.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember that a Private repository cannot show the webpage if you have the free tier Github account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the repository is created in your account. The same webpages you are visiting now will be visible to you at an address of the type https://username.github.io/repository-name-you-chose. You will be able to see all the branches available using the drop-down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you open the branch webpage-quarto, you should see a small message saying initialize webpage-quarto. This is a so-called Github action. Everytime you modify something in the branch webpage-quarto, the webpage will be rendered again, copied in the branch gh-pages, and becomes visible at the web address!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the right side of the repository, you can change the description by clicking on the small symbol located on the top-right corner. You can include the web address, which you can find clicking on Github pages. In this way your webpage address will appear as part of the description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownloading the branches\nThe branches can be downloaded and synchronized using the command line or the software github desktop. To download the two branches from the command line, click first on the green button Code, and copy the repository address.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen use the command line to write\ngit clone -b main ADDRESS-YOU-COPIED your_main\ngit clone -b webpage ADDRESS-YOU-COPIED your_webpage\nThis will create two folders called your_main and your_webpage which you can keep synchronized with github. Pushing changes in the folder your_webpage will update the branch webpage-quarto."

Here you can keep your code, (small) datasets, notebooks, scripts and so on. For large datasets it is better to use other services like Zenodo, which allows up to 50GB per file, and is free.\n\n\nWebpage-quarto branch\nHere you find the description of the main files composing the website. Once you understand how notebooks and markdown files are used to structure the webpage, you can use your own notebooks and create your own markdown pages, update the changes on github, and get your documentation website!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRemember that the webpage will be created automatically every time you push changes to github for the branch webpage-quarto. This is done possible because we have created a workflow in the repository, which can be seen in .github/workflows/publish.yml. In this way you can avoid to create the rendered webpage by hand with quarto every time you do a change.\n\n\n\nWebpages in quarto format\nThere are two webpages in markdown format - index.qmd and publish.qmd - corresponding to the welcome page and to this webpage. Open them and you will see how the text is simple markdown. The only exception is the meta-data at the beginning of each page, with a few descriptive items which are quite self-explicative.\nLINK TO QUARTO ORG\n\n\nNotebooks\nIn the folder notebooks you can see the tutorials. Those will be converted into web format for the webpage, and again need some metadata at the beginning both for descriptive purposes, but also to choose various options.\nTo see the basic example on notebook on the Quarto documentation, click here. Another example for inspiration can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBy default, the notebook does not run when the webpage is created, and is instead kept with the shown results.\n\n\n\n\nYML setup\nThe file _quarto.yml contains all the webpage structure.

    "text": "Geometrical approach - topoMETRY\ntopoMetry works by modelling the geometry of the shape formed by the data points in high dimension. This is done through the so-called discrete Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO). For reference, there is a paper and a documentation page for the package.\n\nHow it works (very, very briefly)\nIn few words, the LBO finds a sort of principal components (called eigenfunctions or eigenvectors) of the geometrical shape formed by the data, which pieced together approximate the original dataset (figure below, right).\nUsually the eigenvectors are less than the dimension of the data, because many of the genes are related by similar expression patterns (figure below, left). The number of eigenvector is the intrinsic dimensionality of the data, which tells you how many dimensions you need to describe the geometry of the data surface.\n\n\n\nWhat can you use the LBO for\nThe LBO is used in the same way as the PCA, which is, its eigenvector matrix is the starting point for other dimensionality reductions. Now, anything you used will be based on geometry and not on PCA distances.\nBelow we go through the steps of using such a tool. Remember: no distance preservation is involved in calculating the LBO, it is all about the geometry (curvature and tangent space in each point).\n\n\nCalculate Intrinsic dimensionality\nFirst of all, we subset the data to the highly variable genes.\n\nadataHVG = adata[:, adata.var.highly_variable].copy()\n\nThen, we calculate the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. This is done with two indices (FSA, MLE) tested on different neighborhoods of each cell. Those two indices estimate the same thing, which is, the intrinsic dimensionality of each cell and its neighbors.\nThe result is a histogram for which the guideline is to choose the peak. However, tails are also important and can give extra dynamics in the data, so I usually select the number of dimensions on the right side of the peak (before the tail flattens out).\nFSA and MLE usually are quite concordant. I usually select the highest estimation of intrinsic dimensionality. Here, for example I choose 250 dimensions.\n\nplt.rcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = (4, 4)\ntp.tpgraph.IntrinsicDim(\n    methods=[\"fsa\", \"mle\"],\n    k=range(10, 60, 10),\n    backend=\"hnswlib\",\n    metric=\"euclidean\",\n    n_jobs=-1,\n    plot=True,\n    random_state=123,\n).fit(adataHVG.X)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the LBO\nNow it is time to calculate the Laplace-Beltrami Operator. This is done in a computer by creating a matrix, where each column is an eigenvector of the operator. Every eigenvector describes a geometrical characteristics of the data surface. Topometry gives choice of methods to calculate LBO with projections and clusters based on that. You can choose\n\nkernels how to calculate similarities\neigenmap_method how to calculate LBO\nprojections which dimensionality reduction to do starting from LBO\nresolution the LBO-based clustering resolution\n\nDo not worry about the first two (find more in the topometry docs). For the third one we choose diffusion maps (MAP) and PaCMAP (which is superior to UMAP in various ways). For the clustering resolution we choose 0.5.\n\n# Run TopOMetry\n\n# Create a TopOGraph object with the desired parameters\ntg = tp.TopOGraph(n_eigs=250, n_jobs=-1, verbosity=1, random_state=42)\n\n# Fit some models to the data\nadata = tp.sc.topological_workflow(\n    adata,\n    tg,\n    kernels=[\"bw_adaptive\"],\n    eigenmap_methods=[\"LE\"],\n    projections=[\"MAP\", \"PaCMAP\"],\n    resolution=0.5,\n)\n\nComputing neighborhood graph...\n Base kNN graph computed in 6.281542 (sec)\n Fitted the bw_adaptive kernel in 0.308347 (sec)\nComputing eigenbasis...\n Fitted eigenbasis with Laplacian Eigenmaps from the bw_adaptive in 8.976884 (sec)\n    Building topological graph from eigenbasis...\n        Computing neighborhood graph...\n Computed in 0.216704 (sec)\n Fitted the bw_adaptive graph kernel in 0.311466 (sec)\n Computed MAP in 10.575032 (sec)\n Computed PaCMAP in 47.988012 (sec)\n\n\nThe resulting projections are inside adata.obsm and have long names which combine the three parameters chosen before to run topoMetry.\nNote also we have a clustering in adata.obs.w_adaptive from LE with bw_adaptive_leiden !

We can look at the distortion of each projection. As when drawing a map of the globe, projecting single cell data will create distortions. Those can be determined with the riemannian metric.\nTopometry uses the metric to draw ellipses around some of the points to show distortions. The directions in which the ellipses are wider are the directions of distortion, and the size of the ellipses’ axae represent the distortion intensity.\n\nRunning the diagnostics\nBelow we plot distortion ellipses on 500 points for all the projections we based on LBO.\n\n# Get the graph Laplacian of our base graph kernel:\nL = tg.base_kernel.L\n\n# Define how many ellipses to plot:\nn_plot = 500\n\n# Convert the labels to integers:\nlabels = adata.obs[\"clusters\"].cat.codes\n\n\n# Name the projections you want to plot:\nprojections = [\"topoMAP\", \"topoPaCMAP\"]\n\n# Plot the Riemann metric\nfor name in projections:\n    xy_coord = adata.obsm[\"X_\" + name][:, :2]\n    tp.pl.plot_riemann_metric(\n        xy_coord,  # The coordinates of the projection\n        L,  # The graph Laplacian\n        std=0.5,  # A scaling factor for the ellipses size\n        n_plot=n_plot,  # How many ellipses to plot\n        labels=labels,\n        title=f\"Riemannian Metric \\n for {name}\",\n        cmap=\"tab20\",  # For coloring\n        random_state=tg.random_state,  # For coloring with same colors as before\n        figsize=(4, 4),  # Size of the figure (NEEDS TO BE SQUARE!!!),\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the first plot with diffusion maps. Ellipses are pretty large and many of them have both axae that are wide, meaning distortions in both directions of the 2D space.\n\nUsually, cells at the edge of the plot have some distortion pointing towards the center. This is phisyological and means that distances are not as large as they appear in the 2D space (similarly to distances which are wrong at the edges of the planar world map).\nIf all cells including those at the center of the plot have large distortions, then the projection is not reliable, because all points coordinates are distorted.\n\nThe diffusion map does not seem a very good projection of the data. PaCMap is definitely more reliable, showing mostly only distortion towards the center from the edges."
