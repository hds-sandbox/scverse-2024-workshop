    "text": "A guide for using the template\nYou can get and use the template as it follows\n\nClick on the button below to go to the template page.\n\nBUTTON\n\nChoose Use this template, then Create a new repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Include all branches. This will copy all the branches mentioned before. Then provide a name and description of your repository, and choose if the repository has to be Public or Private.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember that a Private repository cannot show the webpage if you have the free tier Github account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the repository is created in your account. The same webpages you are visiting now will be visible to you at an address of the type https://username.github.io/repository-name-you-chose. You will be able to see all the branches available using the drop-down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you open the branch webpage-quarto, you should see a small message saying initialize webpage-quarto. This is a so-called Github action. Everytime you modify something in the branch webpage-quarto, the webpage will be rendered again, copied in the branch gh-pages, and becomes visible at the web address!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the right side of the repository, you can change the description by clicking on the small symbol located on the top-right corner. You can include the web address, which you can find clicking on Github pages. In this way your webpage address will appear as part of the description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownloading the branches\nThe branches can be downloaded and synchronized using the command line or the software github desktop. To download the two branches from the command line, click first on the green button Code, and copy the repository address.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen use the command line to write\ngit clone -b main ADDRESS-YOU-COPIED your_main\ngit clone -b webpage ADDRESS-YOU-COPIED your_webpage\nThis will create two folders called your_main and your_webpage which you can keep synchronized with github. Pushing changes in the folder your_webpage will update the branch webpage-quarto."

    "text": "Modifying the material\n\nMain branch\nThe material for your research project should be saved in the main branch. Here you can keep your code, (small) datasets, notebooks, scripts and so on. For large datasets it is better to use other services like Zenodo, which allows up to 50GB per file, and is free.\n\n\nWebpage-quarto branch\nHere you find the description of the main files composing the website. Once you understand how notebooks and markdown files are used to structure the webpage, you can use your own notebooks and create your own markdown pages, update the changes on github, and get your documentation website!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRemember that the webpage will be created automatically every time you push changes to github for the branch webpage-quarto. This is done possible because we have created a workflow in the repository, which can be seen in .github/workflows/publish.yml. In this way you can avoid to create the rendered webpage by hand with quarto every time you do a change.\n\n\n\nWebpages in quarto format\nThere are two webpages in markdown format - index.qmd and publish.qmd - corresponding to the welcome page and to this webpage. Open them and you will see how the text is simple markdown. The only exception is the meta-data at the beginning of each page, with a few descriptive items which are quite self-explicative.\nLINK TO QUARTO ORG\n\n\nNotebooks\nIn the folder notebooks you can see the tutorials. Those will be converted into web format for the webpage, and again need some metadata at the beginning both for descriptive purposes, but also to choose various options.\nTo see the basic example on notebook on the Quarto documentation, click here. Another example for inspiration can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBy default, the notebook does not run when the webpage is created, and is instead kept with the shown results.\n\n\n\n\nYML setup\nThe file _quarto.yml contains all the webpage structure. The section\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Course Template\"\n  navbar:\n    logo: /img/logo.png\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Welcome\n      - href: notebooks/interactivePlotsTransc.ipynb\n        text: Tutorial 1\n      - href: publish.qmd\n        text: Publish\n    right: \n      - icon: github\n        href: https://github.com/hds-sandbox/scverse-2024-workshop\n        aria-label: GitHub\nis used to define\n\nthe title and logo of the webpage (the logo.png file in the img folder)\nthe menus on the left side of the navigation bar (left:). Here you can see the welcome page, the publishing guide and the notebooks with the menu title.\nthe link to the github repository on the right side of the navigation bar (right:), which you need to update according to your new repository\n\nThe last part of the file defines themes for the light and dark mode, which you can personalize if you want. We personalized the light theme with a scss file. For more information about available themes, look here\nYou can easily add or modify content in the menu toolbar starting from this file as an example.\nMore info about the YML file to define the website navigation can be found in this documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to go?\n\n\n\nOk, now you should have gotten the very basics to get your website up and running, starting from the example in the template."
