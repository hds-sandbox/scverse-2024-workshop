                "correct": false,
                "feedback": "False. There is another parameter to decide the number of neighbors. In general, remember it is better to have a high number of neighbors to avoid false separation of clusters."

                "answer": "how distances between points are stretched or compressed in the projection, influencing how spread out or tightly clustered the points appear.",
                "correct": true,
                "feedback": "Correct. The two parameters control the weight of the attractive and repulsive terms of the loss function which is optimized. The parameter a increases the preservation of global structure, while b privileges the repulsive terms which privilege local structure."

                "correct": false,
                "feedback": "False. Generally you do not subsample data and dimensions to create a projection."
